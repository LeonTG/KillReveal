# KillReveal
This gamemode starts out like Secret Teams where no teams are colored but when someone gets a kill however their color is shown on tab you would have to find out teams by people getting kills.

*IMPORTANT*

Once you set the teams using /random you have to reload or restart the server to reset the teams and set them again, don't reload midgame if you want to keep the fake teams, that is for the tab list to not be sorted after teams
